I am interested in applying for the Level 4 apprenticeship program as a software developer with Percayso.

I have completed My BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma in Software Development this year and I am looking for an opportunity to use what I have learnt to progress my career. From college, I have learnt how to effectively plan, for example, I completed my assignments on time in a well-organised manner meeting my deadlines.

Additionally, I am adaptable in different circumstances, such as learning the IDE Visual Studio which has very useful debugging tools. In my free time I have learnt HTML and CSS and like learning about how to create websites. I have learnt the core programming concepts and coding principles which I have used in completing my BTEC.

To conclude, I believe I am self-motivated and will work to the best of my ability. I am a quick learner; a critical thinker and I have a natural have a curiosity about how technology works as it is part of everyone's daily lives.

I look forward to hearing from you.

I am interested in applying for the Level 4 apprenticeship program as a software developer with Ensek.

I have completed My BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma in Software Development this year and I am looking for an opportunity to use what I have learnt to progress my career. From college, I have learnt how to effectively plan, for example, I completed my assignments on time in a well-organised manner meeting my deadlines. For four of my assignments in my last year of college had to be done as a self-study and I was able to complete them by myself learning the criteria outside of college. Moreover, my tutor over emphasised the agile SDLC therefore I know the iterative process.  

Additionally, I am adaptable in different circumstances, such as learning how to use software packages like Microsoft Project as a management tool and the IDE Visual Studio which has very useful debugging tools. In my free time I have learnt HTML and CSS and like learning about how to create websites. I have learnt the core programming concepts and coding principles which I have used in completing my BTEC. Also, i have started making C# applications such as an attendance register system and to do list where I have gained knowledge of ASP.NET.

To conclude, I believe I am self-motivated and will work to the best of my ability. I am a quick learner; a critical thinker and I have a natural have a curiosity about how technology works as it is part of everyone's daily lives.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Hello,
I came across your job posting of Web Development Apprenticeship on LinkedIn and I believe this is a great oppertunity. 
I have completed My BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma in Software Development this year and I am looking for an opportunity to use what I have learnt to progress my career . However, the units on web development which first sparked my intrest in the course was not able to be completed due to the lack of resources the college had on the units. Despite this, I was still passionate about learning web development and learnt HTML, CSS and a Little JavaScript by self learning. I am intressted in both front-end and back-end web developemnt.
Please refer to my attached CV. Thank you for your time and I hope my application receives favorable consideration.
