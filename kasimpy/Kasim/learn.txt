In my free time I enjoy learning about web technologies and increase my knowledge; I have started creating simple websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have a Raspberry Pi in which I have learnt more about Linux systems and using the command line. Additionally, Iâ€™ve used my Raspberry pi to create a LAMP web server and learn Git for verion control. Occasionally, I use GitHub in which I use to upload some of my projects.
